A Python code for efficiently evaluating the redshift-space power spectrum models presented in [arXiv:2105.12933](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12933) using the [FFTLog method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08130).

Additionally, this code can also return the one-loop density and velocity divergence power spectra in Eulerian perturbation theory.
